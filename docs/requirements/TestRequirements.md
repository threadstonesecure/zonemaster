Test requirements
=================

Overview
--------
Zonemaster is based on Zonecheck and DNSCheck, and most of the current set
of requirements are derived from those projects.

However, Zonemaster in its current form stands on its own, and this document
describes the current set of requirements on the tests to implement for
Zonemaster.

Any previous mapping detailing the inheritance on the requirements from
Zonecheck and DNSCheck can be found in older versions of this document.

Source documents
----------------

Most of the requirements are derived from these documents:

Future tests
------------
 * Case insensitivity in a name server, [RFC 4343](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4343).
 * More tests of EDNS(0), [RFC 6891](https://tools.ietf.org/search/rfc6891) and <http://ednscomp.isc.org/>.
 * AXFR is complex, perhaps do more inspection of data coming from AXFR,
   [RFC 5936](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5936).
 * Check for algorithm completeness (DS->DNSKEY->RRSIG) as per section 2.2 of
   [RFC 4035](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4035#section-2.2).
 * ICMP answer
 * Test for referral to root (possible DDoS vector for authoritative name servers)
 * Check to see if removed authoritative name server is still authoritative (requires
   a new input parameter, "previous ns")
 * Test the preservation of qname case in DNS answers, RFC 1035 section 7.1. ("0x20" hack)

Discarded tests
---------------
 * loopback delegation (Section 4.1 of RFC 1912)
 * loopback is resolvable (Section 4.1 of RFC 1912)
 * serial number of the form YYYYMMDDnn (RFC 1912 is not normative)
 * SOA serial may not be zero

Requirements on writing test specifications
-------------------------------------------

These are some requirements for writing specifications for "Zonemaster":

 1. Follow the framework of the IEEE 829-2008.
 2. The documents must be in [GitHub Flavored Markdown].
 3. Keep the columns in the document below 80, preferrably shorter than 74
    columns. (Much easier to see changes in documents using the tools
	available for diffing).
 4. Use [normative language].
 5. Refer to any reference that is the rationale for implementing the test
    case. If there are no reference to any standards, describe the reason
    for implementing the test. For most references, we use RFCs from IETF.
 6. Use well defined terms. Terms such as FQDN and FQHN seems to have dual
    meanings.
 7. The name of the test case might be better than the name of the
    requirements. Feel free to improve the name of the test case if it is
    possible to improve on the wording to make the test case clearer for
    the reader and the user of the software. Text from the test cases
    probably will be reused in other contexts.
 8. Be very clear in what DNS queries are performed, and what answers are
	expected. If a specific DNS protocol flag has to be set in the query,
	specify this as well. In general, be closer to describing the DNS
	protocol actions than to use more generic language.
 9. Use the same headers and titles as in all other test cases. Try
	to use the same style as used in the other tests.
 10. Make sure to write the tests so that any implementer that implements
    the tests will have the same outcome as any other implementation.
