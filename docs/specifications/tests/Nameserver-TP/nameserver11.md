# NAMESERVER11: Test for unknown EDNS OPTION-CODE

## Test case identifier
**NAMESERVER11** 

## Objective

EDNS is a mechanism to announce capabilities of a DNS implementation,
and is now basically required by any new functionality in DNS such as
DNSSEC ([RFC 6891]).

[RFC 6891, section 6.1.2] states that any OPTION-CODE values not understood by a
responder or requestor MUST be ignored. Unknown OPTION-CODE values must be
processed as though the OPTION-CODE was not even there.

In this test case, we will query  with an unknown EDNS OPTION-CODE and expect
that the OPTION-CODE is not present in the response for the query.

## Inputs

"Child Zone" - The domain name to be tested.

## Ordered description of steps to be taken to execute the test case

1. Create a SOA query for the *Child Zone* with an OPT record with 
   EDNS OPTION-CODE set to anything other than it is already assigned as in the
[IANA-DNSSYSTEM-PARAMETERS] and no other EDNS options or flags.

2. Obtain the set of name server IP addresses using [Method4] and [Method5]
   ("Name Server IP").

3. For each name server in *Name Server IP* do:

	1. Send the SOA query to the name server and collect the response.
	2. If there is no DNS response, output *[NO_RESPONSE]* and go to
	next server.
	3. Else, if the DNS response has the RCODE "FORMERR" then output
      	*[NO_EDNS_SUPPORT]*.
	4. Else, if there is an "OPTION-CODE" present in the response, then
	output *[UNKNOWN_OPTION_CODE]*. 
	5. Else, if the DNS response meet the following four criteria,
      	then just go to the next name server (no error):
		1. The SOA is obtained as response in the ANSWER section.
		2. If the DNS response has the RCODE "NOERROR".
		3. The pseudo-section response has an OPT record with version set to 0.
		4. There is no "OPTION-CODE" present in the response.
	6. Else output *[NS_ERROR]*.
 
## Outcome(s)

The outcome of this Test Case is "fail" if there is at least one message
with the severity level *ERROR* or *CRITICAL*.

The outcome of this Test Case is "warning" if there is at least one message
with the severity level *WARNING*, but no message with severity level
*ERROR* or *CRITICAL*.

The outcome of this Test case is "pass" in all other cases.

Message                           | Default severity level (when message is outputed)
:---------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------
NO_RESPONSE                       | WARNING
NO_EDNS_SUPPORT                   | WARNING
NS_ERROR			  | WARNING     
UNKNOWN_OPTION_CODE		  | WARNING     

## Special procedural requirements

If either IPv4 or IPv6 transport is disabled, ignore the evaluation of the
result of any test using this transport protocol and log a message reporting
the ignored result.

## Intercase dependencies

None.
