# NAMESERVER01: A name server should not be a recursor

## Test case identifier
**NAMESERVER01**

## Objective

To ensure consistency in DNS, an authoritative name server should not be
configured to do recursive lookups. Also, open recursive resolvers are
considered bad internet practice due to their capability of assisting in
large scale DDoS attacks. The introduction to [RFC 5358] elaborates on 
mixing recursor and authoritative functionality, and the issue is further 
elaborated by [D.J. Bernstein].

Section 2.5 of [RFC 2870] have very specific requirement on disabling 
recursion functionality on root name servers.

## Inputs

* The domain name to be tested ("Child Zone").

## Ordered description of steps to be taken to execute the test case

1. Create A queries for the following domain names:
   1. xn--nameservertest.iis.se
   2. xn--nameservertest.icann.org
   3. xn--nameservertest.ripe.net

2. Retrieve all name server IPs for the *Child Zone* using 
   [Method4] and [Method5].

3. Repeat the following steps for each name server IP.
   1. Send the three A queries over UDP.
   2. For each query do the following steps:
      1. If the name server does not respond with a DNS 
      	 response, then emit *[NO_RESPONSE]*.
      2. If the DNS response comes with the RA flag set, then 
      	 emit *[IS_A_RECURSOR]*.
   3. If the RCODE is NXDOMAIN in the responses for all three
      queries then emit *[IS_A_RECURSOR]*.
   4. If neither *[NO_RESPONSE]* nor *[IS_A_RECURSOR]* has been emitted 
      for that server, then emit *[NO_RECURSOR]*.

## Outcome(s)

The outcome of this Test Case is "fail" if there is at least one message
with the severity level *ERROR* or *CRITICAL*.

The outcome of this Test Case is "warning" if there is at least one message
with the severity level *WARNING*, but no message with severity level
*ERROR* or *CRITICAL*.

In other cases the outcome of this Test Case is "pass".

Message                       | Default severity level (if message is emitted)
:-----------------------------|:-----------------------------------
NO_RESPONSE                   | WARNING
IS_A_RECURSOR                 | ERROR
NO_RECURSOR                   | INFO

## Special procedural requirements

If either IPv4 or IPv6 transport is disabled, ignore the evaluation of the
result of any test using this transport protocol. Log a message reporting
on the ignored result.

The domain names used in the queries are selected to be almost certainly 
non-existent name since the names are chosen to violate the 
[IDNA 2008 specification] under SLDs (second-level domains) expected to 
respect that specification. The SLDs are selected so that the chance that 
they are all hosted on the same servers is low.

## Intercase dependencies

None.

## Terminology

Valid domain names according to the "IDNA 2008 specification" is found in
[RFC 5890], section 2.3.1, page 7.
